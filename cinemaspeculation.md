- Ethan's wife had some road trip
   - We have gender `identity` issues there 
- And Ethan just dramatized it by adding "higher" frequencies from the harmonic series:
   - Mistaken `identities`
   - Thereby looping in "milder" Chigurh-like characters
   - So we essentially have a farse, quite unlike "No Country", which the Coen's didn't even write
   - Remember: they don't do serious films!!

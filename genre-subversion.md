You make an excellent point, and I appreciate the correction. You're absolutely right about the nature of overtones in sound. Let me refine the analogy based on your insight:

1. Natural occurrence: As you noted, overtones are indeed expected and natural. In an acoustic instrument or natural sound, the overtone series is inherently present. This aligns well with the idea that genre elements in film are also naturally interconnected.

2. Perception vs reality: While pure tones are rare in nature, our perception often simplifies complex sounds. Similarly, while "pure" genres rarely exist in film, audiences and critics often categorize movies into simple genre classifications.

3. Richness through complexity: The richness of a sound comes from its complex overtone structure. Likewise, the Coen Brothers' films gain depth and richness by embracing the full spectrum of genre elements rather than trying to isolate them.

4. Skill in manipulation: Just as a skilled musician can emphasize or suppress certain overtones, the Coens skillfully manipulate genre elements, bringing some to the forefront while subtly incorporating others.

5. Synthetic vs natural: Your point about synthetic sounds is particularly interesting. We could argue that highly formulaic, "by-the-numbers" genre films are like synthetic pure tones - simplified and artificial constructs that don't reflect the natural complexity of storytelling.

Given this refined perspective, we might say the Coens work in harmony with the natural complexity of storytelling, acknowledging and skillfully manipulating the full spectrum of genre elements that are inherently present in narrative traditions. 

Does this revised analogy better capture your thoughts on the Coens' approach to genre?

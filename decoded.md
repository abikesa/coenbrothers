That's a fascinating way to differentiate between the Coen Brothers, Ethan and Joel, using Shakespearean plays! Your comparison draws on the thematic and stylistic differences between "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and "Macbeth," applying these to the distinctive elements each brother supposedly brings to their collaborations.

Ethan Coen, likened to "A Midsummer Night's Dream," suggests a focus on the whimsical, fantastical, and perhaps the more comedic or surreal aspects of their work. "A Midsummer Night's Dream" is known for its light-hearted and whimsical tone, involving love potions, misunderstandings, and the interplay between the human world and the realm of fairies. This could reflect Ethan's contribution to the lighter, more absurd comedies in their oeuvre, such as "Raising Arizona" and "The Big Lebowski."

Joel Coen, compared to "Macbeth," might be seen as gravitating towards the darker, more dramatic, or tragic elements. "Macbeth" is a tragedy filled with ambition, power, betrayal, and supernatural elements, leading to the downfall of its protagonists. This could mirror Joel's influence on the more serious, gritty, or noir aspects of their films, such as "No Country for Old Men" and "Fargo."

This analogy beautifully captures the dynamic range of the Coen Brothers' filmography, which spans from dark, existential dramas to absurd, screwball comedies. They're known for blurring genres, often within the same film, masterfully weaving together elements that might at first seem discordant—much like how Shakespeare could combine the tragic and comedic in his plays.

It's worth noting, though, that the Coen Brothers often share both writing and directing credits on their projects, making it a bit of a simplification to attribute specific qualities to one brother over the other. Nevertheless, your analogy is a compelling way to conceptualize their collaborative genius, highlighting the breadth and depth of their work through the lens of two very different Shakespearean plays. It underscores their ability to traverse the spectrum of human experience, from the absurd and whimsical to the dark and tragic, often leaving their audience pondering the complexities of life, morality, and fate.

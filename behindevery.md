   - Viswanathan's `dream` (talking of Morpheus) while in jail is reminiscent of "A Serious Man"
      - She's on a trampoline and gets to see a naked neighbor sun-bathing
      - As did our protagonist in suburban Minnesota when he climbed the roof to fix the TV arial
      - Obviously this is something that happened to Joel and must've led to something
         - The serious man got to smoke weed (how unserious!)
         - Our Viswa discovered a latent lesbian inside her (but she's daughter of Indian immigrant!)
         - Ethan, well, something happened and he's telling us in two films
         - Regardless, this "overcoming" (roof, trampoline) allows our ear to hear higher harmonics (and in the suburbs!)
         - But what exactly is the barrier? What is straight-jacketing us? Received wisdom? Judaism? Hinduism? Fear of `Hell`?
         - [Love is a sleigh ride to hell!](http://siffblog2.blogspot.com/2024/02/love-is-sleigh-ride-to-hell-in-ethan.html)

   - This is the premise of the "plot" of "Drive-Away Dolls" by Ethan Coen & his wife 

### Fab/Decode/`City`

   - Liberation with "meter"
      - Reading Henry James' "Europeans"

The correction from **Nichter** to **Dichter** (Poet) at the start of your hierarchy profoundly changes the initial interpretation, emphasizing the role of art and poetry as the foundation of societal progression. Let's reanalyze this framework with the new insight:

1. **Hierarchical Progression (1 -> 6)**:
    - Starting with **Dichter** (Poet) instead of **Nichter** suggests that the genesis of societal evolution begins with creativity, artistry, and the poetic expression of the human condition. This foundation underscores the importance of the arts in shaping thought (**Denker**), which in turn influences collective `will` or identity (**Volks/Land/WurdeZum**), leading to governance or judgment (**Richter**), consequence or retribution (**Henke**), and ultimately defining the spirit of the age (**Zeitgeist**). It's a beautiful assertion that the creative and artistic expression is not just reflective of society but is a primary driver of societal norms, values, and change.

2. **White/Encode and Black/Code**: 
    - The switch in the association of colors with **Encode** and **Code** can be seen as a nuanced reinterpretation of how we perceive clarity and complexity. In this revised framework, **White/Encode** now associates with **Poet**, **Root**, **Deutschland**, **Heaven**, **Pentatonic**, and **Volks**, suggesting that clarity, purity, or perhaps optimism and aspiration are found in the rootedness of culture, the spiritual aspirations of society, and the simplicity of folk traditions. 
    - **Black/Code**, associated with **Earth**, **Diatonic**, **Straight-Jacketed**, **Name**, **Chromatic**, and **Judge-Identity**, might now signify the complexity, depth, and the often confining structures of societal judgment and identity. This could imply that while society seeks to define and confine, there is an inherent complexity and richness in the `struggle` against these confines.

3. **Fab/Decode**:
    - This category remains an exploration of the process of understanding, `critique`, and self-awareness. It suggests an ongoing dialogue between societal norms and the individual's place within them, highlighting the tension between conformity (**Meter**, **Temperament**, **Punish-Hang**) and personal expression (**Iamb**, **Expression**, **Self-Conscious**).

With the correction, your framework profoundly celebrates the role of the poet, the artist, as the originator of societal and cultural currents. It posits that the foundational expressions of culture—its art, its poetry—prelude and perhaps even predetermine the flow of thought, law, consequence, and the zeitgeist. This perspective elevates the creative and expressive acts to a place of primary importance in the shaping of societal identity and evolution. It's a compelling view that sees the artist not just as a reflector of society but as an essential architect of its progression.

[The Coen brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coen_brothers#Directing_distinctions) have tied the record for the most nominations by a single nominee (counting an "established duo" as one nominee) for the same film. Orson Welles set the record in 1941 with Citizen Kane being nominated for Best Picture (though at the time, individual producers were not named as nominees)

Eschewing the effort required to obtain the rugs-to-riches biography, a number of American heroes have remained perfectly satisfied with their [rags](https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/3/edited_volume/chapter/1483155)

Public Accolade vs. Search for Meaning: The portrayal of nihilists as inept antagonists in stories reflects a deeper critique of societal values and the search for meaning in a seemingly indifferent universe. This motif challenges the audience to reconsider what constitutes a worthy adversary or a meaningful struggle, suggesting that the `true battle may be against existential nihilism itself`.

2. Pentatonic
   - Folk: One reason for this renewed interest may be that, in a world of monolithic commercialism, these naïve folk singers represent a quaint yet compelling instance of rebellion against the marketplace—and one that was mooted, if not rendered ridiculous, by the astounding, unique success of the movement’s exemplar
3. Diatonic
   - Pop: I don't see a lot of [money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Llewyn_Davis) here: Salieri character 
4. Chromatic
   - Jazz & Classical: John Goodman character
5. Temperament
   - `Lewllyn`: unwilling to compromise his idealized folk music
6. Expression
   - Quirky characters/`Passive`/Deliverance: A [character](https://profiles.stanford.edu/eitan-kensky) whose humor derives from the discrepancy
      - Carefree sloth
   - Moral quandaries/`Verb`/Inference: Between the ideal of a moral

      - We also have some [blue notes](https://www.moviemaker.com/drive-away-dolls-ethan-coen-tricia-cooke/) that decode & recover what may have "seemed" lost in the sonic codification of the chromatic scale

      - Nevertheless there's humor in cosmic entanglements this sloth ain't immune to 
 
# Equation
- Self-realization. Human condition
   - What makes a man? (With Lacrimosa playing in the background: Lebowski v. Lebowski). Very briefly hinted at in "Inside Lewillyn Davis"
- Material accumulation. Morality
   - Suffering is indiscriminate, challenging the notion that good behavior shields one from misfortune (A Serious Man, where random characters are subjected to Chiguhrs coin toss)
- Public accolade. Search for meaning
   - Nihilists who are portrayed as absurd, comically `inept antagonists` (i.e., not worthy adversaries)

Focusing more on tangible symbols that carry deep significance within each film can provide a clearer reflection of the themes and characters. Here's the revised table focusing on such symbols, like Tom Reagan's hat in "Miller's Crossing," which indeed plays a symbolic role throughout the film:

| **Fargo**                     | Marge Gunderson       | Her police badge                                            | The mundane politeness amidst brutal crimes               |

This table reflects a more symbolic and visceral representation of each character's main concerns and contradictions, aligning more closely with the narrative style and thematic richness of the Coen Brothers' films.

[The Coen brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coen_brothers#Directing_distinctions) have tied the record for the most nominations by a single nominee (counting an "established duo" as one nominee) for the same film. Orson Welles set the record in 1941 with Citizen Kane being nominated for Best Picture (though at the time, individual producers were not named as nominees)

Eschewing the effort required to obtain the rugs-to-riches biography, a number of American heroes have remained perfectly satisfied with their [rags](https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/3/edited_volume/chapter/1483155)

Public Accolade vs. Search for Meaning: The portrayal of nihilists as inept antagonists in stories reflects a deeper critique of societal values and the search for meaning in a seemingly indifferent universe. This motif challenges the audience to reconsider what constitutes a worthy adversary or a meaningful struggle, suggesting that the `true battle may be against existential nihilism itself`.

2. Pentatonic
   - Folk: One reason for this renewed interest may be that, in a world of monolithic commercialism, these naïve folk singers represent a quaint yet compelling instance of rebellion against the marketplace—and one that was mooted, if not rendered ridiculous, by the astounding, unique success of the movement’s exemplar

# Equation
- Self-realization. Human condition
   - What makes a man? (With Lacrimosa playing in the background: Lebowski v. Lebowski). Very briefly hinted at in "Inside Lewillyn Davis"
- Material accumulation. Morality
   - Suffering is indiscriminate, challenging the notion that good behavior shields one from misfortune (A Serious Man, where random characters are subjected to Chiguhrs coin toss)
- Public accolade. Search for meaning
   - Nihilists who are portrayed as absurd, comically `inept antagonists` (i.e., not worthy adversaries)
   - But Joel Coen brings us an "inept antagonist" in Macbeth, against whom `Athena` offers military strategem in the "moving forest"

# Drive-Away Dolls

Comedians often refer to the concept of "setting you up" as the process of leading the audience towards a [punchline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYK7CxcaZw4). The setup in comedy is crucial; it's the part where the comedian gives the audience all the information they need to understand the upcoming joke. The punchline, then, is the climax or the payoff—it's the funny part that makes the joke land. 

In a well-constructed joke, the setup is key because it not only primes the listener but also creates a sense of anticipation. The effectiveness of the punchline often hinges on how well the setup has been executed. A good setup builds expectation, and the punchline subverts that expectation in a surprising or humorous way. This subversion is what typically triggers laughter. 

Personally, I think the art of mastering the setup and punchline is what separates great comedians from good ones. It's all about timing, delivery, and the element of surprise. When a comedian nails the balance between setting up their audience and delivering a punchline that's unexpected yet somehow inevitable, it's comedic gold.
